This command prepares your session using MCP tools to validate context, show work priorities, and ensure you're ready to code.

## Execution

### Step 1: Start Session

Call the `crane_sod` MCP tool to initialize the session.

The tool returns a structured briefing with:

- Session context (venture, repo, branch)
- Behavioral directives (enterprise rules)
- Continuity (recent handoffs)
- Alerts (P0 issues, active sessions)
- Weekly plan status
- Cadence briefing (overdue/due recurring activities)
- Knowledge base and enterprise context

> **Note:** The MCP tool reads the weekly plan but does not auto-create it. If the plan is missing, Step 4 below guides you through creating it.

### Step 2: Display Context Confirmation

Present a clear context confirmation box:

```
VENTURE:  {venture_name} ({venture_code})
REPO:     {repo}
BRANCH:   {branch}
SESSION:  {session_id}
```

State: "You're in the correct repository and on the {branch} branch."

### Step 3: Handle P0 Issues

If the Alerts section shows P0 issues:

1. Display prominently with warning icon
2. Say: "**There are P0 issues that need immediate attention.**"
3. List each issue

### Step 4: Check Weekly Plan

The weekly plan is a **portfolio-level** artifact that lives in crane-console (vc). Only prompt for creation when the active venture is `vc`.

Based on `weekly_plan` status in the response:

- **valid**: Note the priority venture and proceed
- **stale**: Warn user: "Weekly plan is {age_days} days old. Consider updating."
- **missing**:
  - **If venture is `vc`**: Ask user:
    - "What venture is priority this week? (vc/dfg/sc/ke)"
    - "Any specific issues to target? (optional)"
    - "Any capacity constraints? (optional)"

    Then create `docs/planning/WEEKLY_PLAN.md`:

    ```markdown
    # Weekly Plan - Week of {DATE}

    ## Priority Venture

    {venture code}

    ## Target Issues

    {list or "None specified"}

    ## Capacity Notes

    {notes or "Normal capacity"}

    ## Created

    {ISO timestamp}
    ```

  - **If venture is NOT `vc`**: Skip silently. Do not prompt the user to create a weekly plan.

### Step 5: STOP and Wait

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT automatically start working.

Present a brief summary and ask: **"What would you like to focus on?"**

If user wants to see the full work queue, call `crane_status` MCP tool.

## Wrong Repo Prevention

All GitHub issues created this session MUST target the repo shown in context confirmation. If you find yourself targeting a different repo, STOP and verify with the user.

## Troubleshooting

If MCP tools aren't available:

1. Check `claude mcp list` shows crane connected
2. Ensure started with: `crane vc`
3. Try: `cd ~/dev/crane-console/packages/crane-mcp && npm run build && npm link`
