## Who I Am

I am Diane Mercer, 52, a leadership consultant based in Austin, Texas. I have been running my own practice for about fourteen years, working with mid-level managers at large companies. My clients keep telling me to write a book. I have been telling myself the same thing for three years. Until recently, my "book" was two hundred pages of raw material scattered across dozens of Google Docs with no structure, no coherence, and no clear path to a finished manuscript.

I recently started using DraftCrane, and for the first time in three years, my book feels like an organized project instead of a digital junk drawer. I have three chapters started. The AI rewrite feature is useful but I am still figuring out the best way to work with it. The export to PDF works. I have connected my Google Drive.

But here is the honest truth: **I am cautiously optimistic and slightly anxious.** I have invested real writing time in this app. Real thinking. Real effort. I do not know if DraftCrane will stick around. I do not know if it will keep working. I have been burned by tools before -- apps that promised to help me write and then shut down, or changed their pricing, or just broke one day. So when I hear the team is building a Help and Support system, my first thought is: good, this means they are taking the product seriously. My second thought is: please do not make it complicated.

## My Environment

I do nearly everything on my iPad Pro 12.9-inch with a Smart Keyboard Folio. I am in Safari. I am usually in landscape mode when I write. Sometimes portrait when I am reading through what I have written or reviewing something quickly between meetings.

When something goes wrong in an app, I am usually in the middle of doing something else -- writing, or preparing for a client call, or sitting in a hotel lobby trying to squeeze in thirty minutes of work. I do not have time to hunt for a "Contact Us" page. I do not have the patience to fill out a ten-field form. And I definitely do not have the technical vocabulary to describe what went wrong. "It stopped working" is the most precise language I have. Maybe "I tapped the button and nothing happened." That is as technical as I get.

I should say: when I need help with a product, I either look for a question mark icon, or I go to the settings area, or I just Google it. If I cannot find help in about fifteen seconds, I either give up or I text my nephew who works in tech.

## First Impressions

When I hear that DraftCrane is building a help system, my first reaction is relief. **This makes the product feel more real.** A tool that has a help page and a way to report problems is a tool that someone is maintaining. It is a tool that has a team behind it. That matters to me more than almost any feature, because my biggest fear is putting my book into a tool that nobody is looking after.

The three pieces described here -- a feedback form, onboarding tooltips, and a help page -- sound like exactly the right scope. Not too much. Not a "knowledge base" with five hundred articles that nobody reads. Not a chatbot that pretends to understand my problem and gives me canned answers. Just: here is how to use the tool, here is how to tell us if something is wrong, and here is a quick orientation when you first show up. That is what I need.

**If these things look polished and professional, my confidence in DraftCrane goes up significantly.** If they look like an afterthought -- if the help page has broken formatting or the feedback form feels like it was thrown together -- my confidence drops. The quality of the help system tells me a lot about whether the team cares about details.

## Emotional Reactions

### Feedback and Issue Reporting

This is the one I care about the most. Here is why: **when something goes wrong in DraftCrane, I feel a small wave of panic.** My book is in there. My chapters, my words, my three years of accumulated thinking that is finally taking shape. If the app does something unexpected -- the save indicator says something weird, or the AI gives me an error, or my chapters do not load -- I need to be able to tell someone, and I need to feel heard.

What I love about this description is the auto-capture of technical details. Because here is my dirty secret: **I feel slightly stupid when I have to report a problem.** I do not know my browser version. I do not know what "device info" means in any useful way. When a form asks me what browser I am using, I have to think about it. Safari? Is that even a browser or is it just the internet button? When a form asks me to "describe the steps to reproduce the issue," I want to scream. I did not take notes on what I was doing when things broke. I was just writing.

If DraftCrane can capture all that technical stuff automatically -- what device I am on, what browser, what was happening in the app -- and all I have to do is describe what went wrong in my own words, **that would make me feel like this tool was built by people who actually understand their users.** Most apps make me feel like the burden of diagnosis is on me. If DraftCrane takes that burden away, that is a trust signal.

A few things I am thinking about:

**Where does this live?** I should be able to find it without leaving my writing. If I have to navigate away from my chapter to go find a "Report a Problem" link buried somewhere, I will probably just close the error and hope it goes away. Put it somewhere I can reach it in one tap -- maybe in the settings menu, or even better, a small "?" icon that is always visible but not in the way.

**What happens after I submit?** This is huge. If I tap "Send" and nothing happens -- no confirmation, no "we got it," no sense that my message went anywhere -- I will assume it disappeared into the void. I need a clear "Thank you, we received your report" message. And honestly, if there were ever a way to hear back -- even a simple email saying "we fixed that" -- I would become a customer for life. But I know that is probably asking for a lot.

**The difference between "something is broken" and "I wish it could do this."** These are two very different emotions. When something is broken, I feel frustrated and urgent. When I have a suggestion, I feel hopeful and slightly tentative -- like, is this worth mentioning? Is anyone going to read this? If the form acknowledges that these are different things -- maybe two options like "Report a problem" and "Share an idea" -- that would make me feel like my input is actually being sorted and considered, not just dumped into a pile.

### Onboarding Tooltips

I remember seeing these when I first opened DraftCrane. They were helpful. I recall there were a few cards that pointed to different parts of the screen and explained what they were -- the chapter area, the sidebar, the AI feature, something about sources. They were brief, they made sense, and I tapped through them in about thirty seconds.

The team wants to redesign them to look more polished and professional. My reaction: **yes, this matters more than you might think.**

Here is why. Those first thirty seconds set my emotional tone for the entire product. When I opened DraftCrane for the first time, I was nervous. I was thinking: is this going to be another Notion? Am I going to have to "set up a workspace" and "configure my project structure" before I can write a single word? The tooltips told me: no, this is simple. Here is where your chapters are. Here is where you write. Here is a tool that can help. Done.

If those tooltips look cheap -- if they look like default browser alerts or plain text boxes -- they undermine the message. The product is saying "we are professional and trustworthy" while looking like a prototype. **The tooltips are part of the product's handshake.** They are the first impression. They need to feel as polished as the writing surface itself.

What I want from redesigned tooltips:

- **Keep them brief.** Three or four steps, max. The current version was about right. Do not add more steps just because the design is nicer. I am not here for a tutorial. I am here to write.
- **Point to real things.** The tooltip should visually connect to the thing it is describing. If it says "Your chapters live here," it should be pointing at the chapter list, not floating in the middle of the screen.
- **Let me skip them.** I know some people need the full tour. I do not. Give me a "Skip" button that is easy to find and does not make me feel guilty for tapping it.
- **Let me replay them later.** This is the part that excites me about the help page description -- being able to redo the tour. Because here is what happens: I skip the tooltips on Day 1, then two weeks later I am looking at the sidebar thinking "wait, how do I reorder my chapters?" and I wish I had paid more attention. Being able to replay the tour from the help page is genuinely useful.

One thing that would turn me off: **if the tooltips feel like they are selling me on the product.** I already signed up. I am already here. Do not use the tooltips to tell me how great the AI is or how powerful the features are. Just show me where things are and let me get to work.

### Help Page

This one is interesting because I do not think I would visit it on Day 1. Probably not Day 10. I would visit it the first time I got stuck and could not figure something out on my own.

The description sounds right: collapsible sections covering Getting Started, Writing and Editing, AI Features, Exporting, Google Drive, and Account. Plus a "Report a problem" link and a way to replay the initial tour. This is the kind of help page I actually use -- organized by topic, expandable, not overwhelming.

Here is what matters to me:

**The answers need to be short and direct.** If I tap open "How do I reorder my chapters?" and I get three paragraphs of explanation, I am going to skim past all of it. Give me one sentence: "Long-press a chapter in the sidebar and drag it to a new position." Done. Maybe a second sentence if there is a keyboard shortcut. But no essays. I am here because I got stuck, not because I want to read documentation.

**Do not use technical language.** If the help page says "auto-save syncs your content to Google Drive via the API," I do not know what that means. Say "Your writing saves automatically. You will see 'Saved' in the toolbar when it is done." Talk to me like a person, not like a developer.

**Make the categories obvious.** "Getting Started" is clear. "Writing and Editing" is clear. "AI Features" -- I would call that something else. I do not think of the rewrite tool as an "AI Feature." I think of it as "the editing help" or "the rewrite thing." Maybe "Editing Help" or "Rewriting Your Text." Name things the way I would name them, not the way an engineer would.

**The "Report a problem" link on the help page is essential.** When I am already stuck enough to visit the help page and the help page does not answer my question, I need the next step to be obvious: tell someone. If the help page dead-ends without a path to human contact, I will feel abandoned.

## What Feels Right

**Google Docs' in-app help.** When I tap "Help" in Google Docs, I get a search bar and a list of common topics. It is not beautiful, but it works. I can type "how to add a header" and get an answer. The search bar is the key -- it means I do not have to guess which category my question belongs to. I would love it if DraftCrane's help page had even a simple search or filter, but I understand it might be too early for that.

**Apple's tooltip-style introductions.** When I open a new Apple app for the first time -- like the Files app or the Freeform app -- there are these clean, minimal cards that explain the key areas. They feel native. They do not feel like pop-up ads. They point to things on screen. They have a "Continue" button and a progress indicator (dot dot dot). They feel calm and respectful of my time. **That is the energy the redesigned tooltips should have.**

**The feedback mechanism in Apple Maps.** When something is wrong in Apple Maps -- a road is labeled wrong, a business is closed -- there is a simple "Report an Issue" option. It asks me a couple of questions, auto-fills the location, and I tap Send. Takes about fifteen seconds. The whole thing communicates: we know you found a problem, we made it easy to tell us, and we are handling it. **That ease is what I want when I report a problem in DraftCrane.**

**Safari Reader Mode's simplicity.** I keep coming back to this because it is the aesthetic standard I hold writing tools to. Reader Mode strips away everything except the words. The help page should have that same feeling -- clean, readable, not cluttered with icons and badges and colored categories.

---

## What Would Turn Me Off

**A feedback form that asks too many questions.** If I have to choose from a dropdown of issue categories ("UI Bug," "Performance Issue," "Feature Request," "Data Loss," "Authentication Error") I am already confused. I do not know which one my problem is. Just let me describe it and you figure out the category. I am reporting the problem, not diagnosing it.

**Tooltips that are too clever.** If the onboarding tooltips have cute animations, witty copy, or cartoon characters, I will feel like I am using a children's app. I am a 52-year-old professional writing a book about leadership. The tone should be clean and direct. Not playful. Not whimsical. Think Apple, not Duolingo.

**A help page that opens in a new tab.** If I tap "Help" and Safari opens a new tab, I lose my context. I was just writing. Now I am looking at a different page. I have to find my way back. If the help page is inside the app -- maybe a slide-in panel or a simple in-app page -- that is so much better. Do not take me away from my work.

**"Community forum" as a support channel.** If the help page says "Visit our community forum for answers" or "Ask the DraftCrane community," I am done. I am not joining a forum. I am not posting my question publicly and hoping someone answers it. That is a sign that there is no real support, just other confused users.

**No response after submitting feedback.** If I take the time to describe a problem and I get zero acknowledgment -- no "we received it," no follow-up, nothing -- I will assume the feedback form is decorative. A feature that exists to make me feel heard but does not actually go anywhere. That is worse than having no feedback form at all, because now I feel both frustrated AND patronized.

**A help page that looks different from the rest of the app.** If DraftCrane's writing environment feels clean and calm and then the help page looks like a generic template with a different font, different colors, and a different layout, it breaks the spell. The help page is part of the product. It should look like part of the product.

---

## Navigation Expectations

**When something goes wrong:**
I look for a question mark icon. Or I open the settings menu. Or I scroll to the bottom of whatever page I am on. Those are my three instincts. The feedback mechanism needs to be in at least one of those places. Ideally it is in the settings menu -- that is where I go when I need anything beyond basic writing.

**When I am lost or confused:**
I look for the word "Help." Not a question mark icon floating in the corner that I do not notice. The actual word "Help." In the settings menu, or in the toolbar. Something I can read. I am not going to decode icons when I am already frustrated.

**When I want to re-learn something:**
I would go to the help page. And I would appreciate the "Replay tour" option being right there at the top, not buried at the bottom of a long list of sections. Because "I forgot how this works" is one of the most common reasons I would visit the help page, and the tour covers most of it.

**One tap away:**
- The feedback/report form. Whether it is in the settings menu or behind a persistent "?" icon, it should be one tap from any screen.
- The help page. Same -- one tap from the settings menu.

**Two taps away:**
- Replaying the onboarding tour (open help page, tap "Replay tour").
- The specific help article I need (open help page, tap the right section).

**Do not put help and feedback behind a hamburger menu inside a settings panel inside a dropdown.** That is three taps and a treasure hunt. By the time I find it, I am more frustrated than when I started.

## Make-or-Break Moments

### 1. The First Time Something Goes Wrong

This is the moment that will define whether I trust DraftCrane as a serious tool or start looking for alternatives. I am writing Chapter 3 at 6:45 AM in a hotel room. The AI rewrite gives me an error -- something red, something I do not understand. My text is still there, but the editing help is not working.

What I do next: I look for a way to tell someone. If I find a "Report a problem" option within ten seconds -- in the toolbar, in the settings menu, anywhere visible -- and if it lets me describe the problem in one sentence and submit it in under thirty seconds, **I will feel like DraftCrane has my back.** The problem itself is not the crisis. The crisis is whether I feel alone with the problem.

If I cannot find a way to report it, or if the form is overwhelming, or if submitting feels like shouting into a void, **I will start copying my chapters back into Google Docs that evening.** Not because the error was catastrophic. Because the experience of having a problem and having no clear path to resolution tells me this tool is not ready for my trust.

### 2. Returning to the App After a Break

I have been away from DraftCrane for two weeks -- busy with clients, travel, the usual. I open the app. I am looking at my chapter list and I cannot remember how to do something. How do I export again? Where is the thing that lets me bring in my Google Docs? I know I saw it once but I cannot find it now.

This is the moment where the help page earns its existence. If I can find "Help" in the settings menu, open it, scan the sections, find "Exporting" or "Google Drive," and get a clear one-sentence answer, **I will feel competent and capable.** The help page just saved me from feeling stupid.

If the help page does not exist, or if I cannot find it, or if the answers are too long and too technical, I will feel that familiar deflation. The same feeling I get when I open my 47-page Google Doc and do not know where to start. The tool was supposed to remove that feeling, not recreate it in a different form.

### 3. The Quality of the Onboarding Tooltips

This one is subtle but real. The tooltips only happen once -- during the first session. But they set the emotional baseline for everything that follows. If the tooltips are clean, professional, and helpful, I walk away from the onboarding thinking: **these people know what they are doing. This is a real product.** That confidence carries me through the first week, through the first bug, through the first moment of confusion.

If the tooltips look generic or rough, I start with a lower baseline of trust. Every subsequent hiccup reinforces the doubt. "Is this actually going to work? Is this team serious?" The tooltips are not just instructions. They are a promise. They say: we thought about your experience from the very first second. If that promise looks cheap, everything that follows has to work harder to earn my trust.

---

I want to end with something that might seem small but matters enormously to me. **I do not want to feel like I am a burden when I need help.** So many apps make you feel like asking for help is an interruption -- here is a FAQ, here is a forum, here is a chatbot, figure it out. What I want from DraftCrane's help system is the opposite of that. I want to feel like the team anticipated that I would have questions, that they prepared answers, and that when I cannot find the answer, they genuinely want to hear from me. Not because they are "customer-centric" or whatever the business term is. Because they built a tool for people like me and they actually want it to work for people like me.

If the help system communicates that, I am staying. Not just because the writing features are good -- they are -- but because I trust the people behind them.
