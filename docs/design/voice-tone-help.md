# Voice & Tone Guide - Help & Support (#346)

Reference for writing Help page content, feedback confirmations, onboarding
tooltips, and error messages across DraftCrane.

## Core Principle

Write like a knowledgeable friend explaining something at a coffee shop. Short
sentences. No jargon. No corporate padding.

## Voice Rules

1. **Author-centric vocabulary.** "Your chapter" not "the document." "Your
   book" not "the project." "Sources" not "attachments."
2. **Direct answers.** Lead with what the user can do, not how the system
   works. "Tap the + button" not "The system supports chapter creation via..."
3. **Present tense.** "Your work saves automatically" not "Your work will be
   saved automatically."
4. **No hedging.** "Yes" not "Yes, you can!" Avoid exclamation marks entirely.
5. **No em dashes.** Use hyphens or restructure the sentence.

## Tone by Context

| Context            | Tone             | Example                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| FAQ answer         | Calm, direct     | "Select a passage of text. A toolbar will appear."       |
| Onboarding tooltip | Warm, brief      | "This is your chapter. Start writing here."              |
| Feedback confirm   | Grateful, honest | "Thanks for your feedback"                               |
| Error message      | Calm, actionable | "Something went wrong. Please try again."                |
| Empty state        | Encouraging      | "A quiet place to write and shape your nonfiction book." |

## Anti-Patterns

- "We leverage..." / "DraftCrane utilizes..." (corporate speak)
- "Just simply..." (condescending)
- "Oops!" / "Uh oh!" (infantilizing for the target audience)
- "Your feedback is important to us" (empty promise)
- Technical terms: API, endpoint, D1, R2, worker, sync, cache
- Feature marketing: "powerful," "seamless," "cutting-edge"

## Length Guidelines

- FAQ answer: 1-2 sentences. If it takes more, the UI needs fixing.
- Tooltip: 1 sentence, max 15 words.
- Toast: 3-6 words. "Thanks for your feedback." "Chapter deleted."
- Error: 1 sentence + 1 action. "Something went wrong. Please try again."

## Pronouns

- "You" / "your" for the user.
- "We" for DraftCrane (the team, not a corporation).
- Never "I" (DraftCrane is not a person).
