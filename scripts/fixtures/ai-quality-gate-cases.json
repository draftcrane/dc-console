    "selectedText": "The inexorable passage of temporal reality had, over the course of what felt like an interminable sequence of days bleeding into weeks and months, gradually eroded the once seemingly impenetrable fortifications I had so painstakingly constructed around the most vulnerable recesses of my emotional landscape. I found myself, with increasing and somewhat alarming frequency, succumbing to the overwhelming gravitational pull of memories I had previously managed to keep sequestered behind walls of deliberate forgetfulness. Each recollection that surfaced brought with it a cascade of associated sensory experiences—the particular quality of autumn light filtering through curtained windows, the distant melodic refrain of a song whose lyrics I could no longer fully reconstruct, the phantom warmth of a hand that had long since released its gentle grip on my own.",
    "contextBefore": "That year changed everything for me. I didn't realize it at the time, but looking back, I can see the cracks forming long before the walls came down.",
    "contextAfter": "By December, I had stopped pretending. The grief was simply there, like weather, and I learned to walk through it rather than around it.",

    "selectedText": "The implementation of a microservices architecture necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the distributed systems paradigm, wherein individual service components operate as autonomous computational entities that communicate through well-defined application programming interfaces. The decomposition of monolithic applications into discrete, independently deployable service units introduces significant operational complexity, particularly with respect to inter-service communication orchestration, distributed state management, and the maintenance of data consistency across service boundaries. Furthermore, the adoption of containerization technologies, exemplified by Docker and orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, provides the foundational infrastructure upon which these distributed service topologies can be reliably instantiated and managed at scale.",
    "contextBefore": "Modern software development has evolved dramatically over the past decade. Teams are increasingly moving away from traditional approaches.",
    "contextAfter": "In practice, most teams find that starting with a modular monolith and extracting services only when clear boundaries emerge produces better results than beginning with microservices from day one.",

    "selectedText": "My grandmother's kitchen was always warm. It was warm in the winter when the old cast-iron radiator clanked and hissed in the corner, and it was warm in the summer when the afternoon sun poured through the window above the sink, heating the worn linoleum floor until it was almost too hot to stand on in bare feet. The warmth wasn't just physical, though. There was a warmth that came from the way she moved through that small space, from the sounds of her humming half-remembered hymns while she rolled out dough on the flour-dusted counter, from the ever-present smell of something baking or simmering or just finished cooling on the wire rack by the window. She made that kitchen feel like the safest place in the entire world, and for a long time, it was.",
    "contextBefore": "We spent every summer at her house on Maple Street. Those visits shaped who I became in ways I'm only now beginning to understand.",

    "selectedText": "When we talk about database indexing, what we are essentially referring to is the process of creating auxiliary data structures that serve the purpose of enabling the database management system to locate and retrieve specific rows of data from tables in a more efficient manner than would be possible if the system had to perform a full sequential scan of every row in the table. The most commonly encountered type of index in modern relational database systems is the B-tree index, which organizes key values in a balanced tree structure that allows for logarithmic-time lookups, meaning that the number of disk pages that need to be read grows proportionally to the logarithm of the total number of records rather than proportionally to the total number of records themselves. This represents a very significant performance improvement, especially when dealing with tables that contain millions or even billions of rows of data.",
    "contextBefore": "Query performance is the single most impactful factor in application responsiveness. Understanding what happens beneath your ORM is essential.",
    "contextAfter": "Choosing which columns to index requires careful analysis of your actual query patterns. Over-indexing carries its own costs: slower writes and increased storage.",

    "contextBefore": "Serverless architectures introduce unique challenges for stateful resources like database connections.",
