<h3>Grounded Theory</h3>
<p>Qualitative research methods provide rich, contextual data that quantitative approaches often miss. The grounded theory approach, developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967), builds theory inductively from systematic data analysis. Triangulation — using multiple data sources, methods, or researchers — strengthens the credibility of qualitative findings. Semi-structured interviews allow researchers to explore unexpected themes while maintaining a consistent framework across participants. Phenomenological analysis seeks to understand the lived experience of participants, bracketing the researcher's preconceptions. The sample size in qualitative research is determined by data saturation rather than statistical power calculations. Coding reliability can be assessed through inter-rater agreement metrics such as Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960). Mixed-methods research designs combine qualitative depth with quantitative breadth, though they require expertise in both paradigms. "The purpose of qualitative inquiry is not to generalize but to illuminate the particular," wrote Patton (2002, p. 46). Ethnographic fieldwork demands extended immersion in the research context, typically spanning months or years.

<h3>Interview Techniques</h3>
<p>"Tell me about a time when you faced a significant challenge at work," I began the interview with candidate #14. The interviewee paused for several seconds before responding: "Honestly, the hardest thing was admitting I didn't have the answer." Active listening during interviews requires the researcher to resist the urge to interpret or redirect too quickly. Rapport-building techniques include mirroring body language, maintaining appropriate eye contact, and using the participant's name. Probe questions such as "Can you tell me more about that?" and "What happened next?" elicit richer narratives than closed-ended questions. "I never expected the conversation to go in that direction," reflected Dr. Maria Santos in her research journal entry from March 2019. Recording interviews with participant consent allows for accurate transcription and reduces note-taking distraction. Member checking — sharing transcripts or interpretations with participants for validation — enhances the trustworthiness of qualitative data. Cultural sensitivity in cross-cultural interviews extends beyond language translation to include awareness of power dynamics and social norms. Focus groups generate data through participant interaction, revealing shared meanings and social dynamics that individual interviews cannot capture.
