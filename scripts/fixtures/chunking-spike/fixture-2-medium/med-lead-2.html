<h1>Servant Leadership in Practice</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Effective leadership requires a combination of vision, empathy, and decisive action. Leaders who
  demonstrate vulnerability often build stronger teams than those who project invincibility.
  According to Goleman (1995), emotional intelligence accounts for nearly 90 percent of what
  distinguishes star performers from average ones. The transformational leadership model emphasizes
  inspiring followers through a shared vision rather than relying on transactional reward systems.
  "I learned more about leadership from my failures than from any textbook," noted General Powell in
  his 2012 memoir. Servant leadership, first articulated by Robert K. Greenleaf in 1970, prioritizes
  the growth and well-being of team members above all else. A meta-analysis of 87 studies (Judge et
  al., 2002) found that conscientiousness and extraversion were the strongest personality predictors
  of leadership effectiveness. The distinction between management and leadership remains one of the
  most debated topics in organizational psychology. Cross-cultural leadership research reveals that
  humility is valued as a leadership trait in collectivist cultures but may be perceived as weakness
  in individualist contexts. Digital transformation has created demand for leaders who can navigate
  ambiguity and rapid technological change simultaneously. Effective leadership requires a
