<h1>Qualitative Data Analysis</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Qualitative research methods provide rich, contextual data that quantitative approaches often miss. The grounded theory approach, developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967), builds theory inductively from systematic data analysis. Triangulation — using multiple data sources, methods, or researchers — strengthens the credibility of qualitative findings. Semi-structured interviews allow researchers to explore unexpected themes while maintaining a consistent framework across participants. Phenomenological analysis seeks to understand the lived experience of participants, bracketing the researcher's preconceptions. The sample size in qualitative research is determined by data saturation rather than statistical power calculations. Coding reliability can be assessed through inter-rater agreement metrics such as Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960). Mixed-methods research designs combine qualitative depth with quantitative breadth, though they require expertise in both paradigms. "The purpose of qualitative inquiry is not to generalize but to illuminate the particular," wrote Patton (2002, p. 46). Ethnographic fieldwork demands extended immersion in the research context, typically spanning months or years.
