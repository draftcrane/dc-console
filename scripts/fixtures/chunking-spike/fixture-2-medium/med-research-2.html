<h1>Interview Protocol Design</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>"Tell me about a time when you faced a significant challenge at work," I began the interview with candidate #14. The interviewee paused for several seconds before responding: "Honestly, the hardest thing was admitting I didn't have the answer." Active listening during interviews requires the researcher to resist the urge to interpret or redirect too quickly. Rapport-building techniques include mirroring body language, maintaining appropriate eye contact, and using the participant's name. Probe questions such as "Can you tell me more about that?" and "What happened next?" elicit richer narratives than closed-ended questions. "I never expected the conversation to go in that direction," reflected Dr. Maria Santos in her research journal entry from March 2019. Recording interviews with participant consent allows for accurate transcription and reduces note-taking distraction. Member checking — sharing transcripts or interpretations with participants for validation — enhances the trustworthiness of qualitative data. Cultural sensitivity in cross-cultural interviews extends beyond language translation to include awareness of power dynamics and social norms. Focus groups generate data through participant interaction, revealing shared meanings and social dynamics that individual interviews cannot capture.
