<h1>Building High-Performance Teams</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tuckman's model describes four stages of group development: forming, storming, norming, and performing (1965). Psychological safety, defined by Edmondson (1999), enables team members to take interpersonal risks without fear of punishment. Google's Project Aristotle found that psychological safety was the most important factor distinguishing high-performing teams. Social loafing — reduced individual effort in groups — increases with group size and decreases with task meaningfulness. Groupthink occurs when the desire for consensus overrides realistic appraisal of alternatives, often leading to poor decisions. Cross-functional teams bring diverse expertise but face coordination challenges due to different professional languages and priorities. Virtual team effectiveness depends on establishing clear communication norms and building trust through consistent follow-through. Conflict in teams is not inherently destructive; task-related conflict can improve decision quality when managed constructively. "The best teams are not those that avoid conflict but those that have learned to disagree productively," observed Lencioni (2002). Team cohesion is positively correlated with performance, but excessive cohesion can lead to insularity and resistance to outside input.
