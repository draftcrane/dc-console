  "Tell me about a time when you faced a significant challenge at work," I began the interview with
  candidate #14. The interviewee paused for several seconds before responding: "Honestly, the
  hardest thing was admitting I didn't have the answer." Active listening during interviews requires
  the researcher to resist the urge to interpret or redirect too quickly. Rapport-building
  techniques include mirroring body language, maintaining appropriate eye contact, and using the
  participant's name. Probe questions such as "Can you tell me more about that?" and "What happened
  next?" elicit richer narratives than closed-ended questions. "I never expected the conversation to
  go in that direction," reflected Dr. Maria Santos in her research journal entry from March 2019.
  Recording interviews with participant consent allows for accurate transcription and reduces
  note-taking distraction. Member checking — sharing transcripts or interpretations with
  participants for validation — enhances the trustworthiness of qualitative data. Cultural
  sensitivity in cross-cultural interviews extends beyond language translation to include awareness
  of power dynamics and social norms. Focus groups generate data through participant interaction,
  revealing shared meanings and social dynamics that individual interviews cannot capture. "Tell me

  techniques include mirroring body language, maintaining appropriate eye contact, and using the
  participant's name. Probe questions such as "Can you tell me more about that?" and "What happened
  next?" elicit richer narratives than closed-ended questions. "I never expected the conversation to
  go in that direction," reflected Dr. Maria Santos in her research journal entry from March 2019.
  Recording interviews with participant consent allows for accurate transcription and reduces
  note-taking distraction. Member checking — sharing transcripts or interpretations with
  participants for validation — enhances the trustworthiness of qualitative data. Cultural
  sensitivity in cross-cultural interviews extends beyond language translation to include awareness
  of power dynamics and social norms. Focus groups generate data through participant interaction,
  revealing shared meanings and social dynamics that individual interviews cannot capture. "Tell me
  about a time when you faced a significant challenge at work," I began the interview with candidate
  #14. The interviewee paused for several seconds before responding: "Honestly, the hardest thing
  was admitting I didn't have the answer." Active listening during interviews requires the
