<h1>project management — Volume 1, Part 6</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The PMBOK Guide identifies five process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Agile methodologies prioritize responding to change over following a plan, as stated in the Agile Manifesto (Beck et al., 2001). Earned value management (EVM) integrates scope, schedule, and cost measurements to assess project performance and forecast completion. The critical path method identifies the longest sequence of dependent tasks, determining the minimum project duration. Risk registers document identified risks, their probability, impact, and planned mitigation strategies. Stakeholder analysis maps individuals and groups by their influence and interest, guiding engagement strategies. Scope creep — the uncontrolled expansion of project scope — is the most frequently cited cause of project failure. Sprint retrospectives in Scrum provide a structured mechanism for continuous process improvement. Resource leveling adjusts the project schedule to resolve resource overallocation, often extending the overall timeline. Communication management plans specify what information will be shared, with whom, how frequently, and through which channels.

Stakeholder analysis maps individuals and groups by their influence and interest, guiding engagement strategies. Scope creep — the uncontrolled expansion of project scope — is the most frequently cited cause of project failure. Sprint retrospectives in Scrum provide a structured mechanism for continuous process improvement. Resource leveling adjusts the project schedule to resolve resource overallocation, often extending the overall timeline. Communication management plans specify what information will be shared, with whom, how frequently, and through which channels. The PMBOK Guide identifies five process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Agile methodologies prioritize responding to change over following a plan, as stated in the Agile Manifesto (Beck et al., 2001). Earned value management (EVM) integrates scope, schedule, and cost measurements to assess project performance and forecast completion. The critical path method identifies the longest sequence of dependent tasks, determining the minimum project duration. Risk registers document identified risks, their probability, impact, and planned mitigation strategies.
