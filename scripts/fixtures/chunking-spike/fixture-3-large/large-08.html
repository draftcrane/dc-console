<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Porter's Five Forces framework analyzes competitive intensity: threat of new entrants, buyer
  power, supplier power, substitutes, and rivalry. Blue ocean strategy advocates creating
  uncontested market space rather than competing in existing, crowded markets (Kim & Mauborgne,
  2005). SWOT analysis, while widely taught, is often criticized for producing superficial
  observations without clear strategic implications. Scenario planning develops multiple plausible
  futures to test strategy robustness, rather than predicting a single outcome. The resource-based
  view of the firm (Barney, 1991) argues that sustainable competitive advantage derives from
  resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN). Platform business
  models create value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent user groups.
  Disruptive innovation, as described by Christensen (1997), initially targets overlooked market
  segments with simpler, cheaper alternatives. Dynamic capabilities — the ability to sense, seize,
  and transform — enable firms to adapt to rapidly changing environments (Teece, 2007). The balanced
  scorecard translates strategic objectives into measurable targets across four perspectives:
  financial, customer, internal process, and learning. First-mover advantage is not automatic; fast
  followers who learn from pioneers' mistakes often capture more value. Porter's Five Forces
