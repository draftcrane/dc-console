<h1>organizational change — Volume 2, Part 3</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Kurt Lewin's three-stage model of change — unfreeze, change, refreeze — remains foundational despite criticism of its linearity. Resistance to change is not inherently irrational; it often reflects legitimate concerns about job security, competence, and identity. Kotter's eight-step process for leading change (1996) begins with creating a sense of urgency and building a guiding coalition. Organizational culture, defined by Schein (2010) as shared basic assumptions, is both the greatest enabler and the greatest barrier to change. Change fatigue occurs when employees experience too many concurrent or overlapping change initiatives, leading to disengagement and cynicism. The psychological contract between employer and employee is frequently violated during major organizational restructuring. Appreciative inquiry offers an alternative to deficit-based change models by focusing on what works well and amplifying those strengths. "People don't resist change. They resist being changed," observed Peter Senge in The Fifth Discipline (1990). Middle managers play a critical role in translating strategic change initiatives into operational reality, yet they are often overlooked in change planning. Digital transformation efforts fail at rates between 60 and 85 percent, according to multiple McKinsey studies (2018-2023).

<p>Kurt Lewin's three-stage model of change — unfreeze, change, refreeze — remains foundational despite criticism of its linearity. Resistance to change is not inherently irrational; it often reflects legitimate concerns about job security, competence, and identity. Kotter's eight-step process for leading change (1996) begins with creating a sense of urgency and building a guiding coalition. Organizational culture, defined by Schein (2010) as shared basic assumptions, is both the greatest enabler and the greatest barrier to change. Change fatigue occurs when employees experience too many concurrent or overlapping change initiatives, leading to disengagement and cynicism. The psychological contract between employer and employee is frequently violated during major organizational restructuring. Appreciative inquiry offers an alternative to deficit-based change models by focusing on what works well and amplifying those strengths. "People don't resist change. They resist being changed," observed Peter Senge in The Fifth Discipline (1990). Middle managers play a critical role in translating strategic change initiatives into operational reality, yet they are often overlooked in change planning. Digital transformation efforts fail at rates between 60 and 85 percent, according to multiple McKinsey studies (2018-2023).
