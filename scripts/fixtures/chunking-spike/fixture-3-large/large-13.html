<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Regression analysis assumes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables,
  which may not hold in complex systems. The p-value threshold of 0.05, while widely used, is an
  arbitrary convention that has been increasingly questioned by statisticians (Wasserstein & Lazar,
  2016). Effect sizes provide practical significance information that p-values alone cannot convey.
  Bayesian analysis offers an alternative framework that incorporates prior knowledge and yields
  probability distributions rather than point estimates. Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces
  high-dimensional data to a smaller set of uncorrelated variables while preserving maximum
  variance. Survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards
  models, are essential for time-to-event data. The assumption of normally distributed residuals
  should be verified through Q-Q plots and formal tests such as Shapiro-Wilk. Machine learning
  algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting can capture nonlinear relationships that
  traditional regression misses. Multicollinearity among predictor variables inflates standard
  errors and makes individual coefficient estimates unreliable. Cross-validation partitions the
  dataset into training and test sets to assess model generalization performance. Regression
