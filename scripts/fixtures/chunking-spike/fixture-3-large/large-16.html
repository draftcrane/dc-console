<h1>coaching psychology — Volume 2, Part 7</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The GROW model (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) provides a structured framework for coaching conversations. Positive psychology coaching focuses on leveraging client strengths rather than remedying deficits. Motivational interviewing, originally developed for addiction treatment, has been adapted for executive coaching contexts. Self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) identifies autonomy, competence, and relatedness as fundamental psychological needs. The coaching alliance — the quality of the relationship between coach and client — is the strongest predictor of coaching outcomes. 360-degree feedback instruments collect performance data from supervisors, peers, direct reports, and the individual being assessed. Cognitive behavioral coaching applies CBT principles to help clients identify and restructure unhelpful thought patterns. "What would success look like for you?" is perhaps the most powerful question a coach can ask, according to Whitmore (2009). Reflective practice involves systematic examination of one's own professional actions and their underlying assumptions. Coaching supervision, though underutilized, helps coaches maintain objectivity and manage the emotional demands of their work.
