<h1>digital transformation — Volume 2, Part 10</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Digital transformation is not merely about technology adoption; it requires fundamental changes to
  organizational culture and processes. Cloud computing reduces capital expenditure by converting
  infrastructure costs from CAPEX to OPEX through pay-as-you-go models. API-first architecture
  enables organizations to expose capabilities as services, fostering ecosystem integration and
  partner innovation. The "technology stack" for modern enterprises typically includes cloud
  infrastructure, data platforms, application layers, and integration middleware. Legacy system
  modernization strategies include: rehost (lift and shift), refactor, rearchitect, rebuild, and
  replace. Data governance frameworks establish policies for data quality, security, privacy, and
  lifecycle management across the organization. Robotic process automation (RPA) handles repetitive,
  rule-based tasks at 30-50% lower cost than manual processing. Customer experience (CX) design has
  become the primary driver of digital transformation investments since 2020. Technical debt
  accumulates when expedient solutions are chosen over architecturally sound ones, increasing
  long-term maintenance costs. DevOps practices — CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, automated
  testing — reduce deployment frequency from months to minutes. Digital transformation is not merely
