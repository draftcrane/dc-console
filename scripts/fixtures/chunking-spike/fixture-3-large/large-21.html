<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Qualitative research methods provide rich, contextual data that quantitative approaches often
  miss. The grounded theory approach, developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967), builds theory
  inductively from systematic data analysis. Triangulation — using multiple data sources, methods,
  or researchers — strengthens the credibility of qualitative findings. Semi-structured interviews
  allow researchers to explore unexpected themes while maintaining a consistent framework across
  participants. Phenomenological analysis seeks to understand the lived experience of participants,
  bracketing the researcher's preconceptions. The sample size in qualitative research is determined
  by data saturation rather than statistical power calculations. Coding reliability can be assessed
  through inter-rater agreement metrics such as Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960). Mixed-methods research
  designs combine qualitative depth with quantitative breadth, though they require expertise in both
  paradigms. "The purpose of qualitative inquiry is not to generalize but to illuminate the
  particular," wrote Patton (2002, p. 46). Ethnographic fieldwork demands extended immersion in the
  research context, typically spanning months or years. Qualitative research methods provide rich,
