<h1>Executive Coaching Best Practices</h1>
<h2>The GROW Model</h2>
<p>
  The GROW model (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) provides a structured framework for coaching
  conversations. Positive psychology coaching focuses on leveraging client strengths rather than
  remedying deficits. Motivational interviewing, originally developed for addiction treatment, has
  been adapted for executive coaching contexts. Self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000)
  identifies autonomy, competence, and relatedness as fundamental psychological needs. The coaching
  alliance — the quality of the relationship between coach and client — is the strongest predictor
  of coaching outcomes. 360-degree feedback instruments collect performance data from supervisors,
  peers, direct reports, and the individual being assessed. Cognitive behavioral coaching applies
  CBT principles to help clients identify and restructure unhelpful thought patterns. "What would
  success look like for you?" is perhaps the most powerful question a coach can ask, according to
  Whitmore (2009). Reflective practice involves systematic examination of one's own professional
  actions and their underlying assumptions. Coaching supervision, though underutilized, helps
  coaches maintain objectivity and manage the emotional demands of their work. The GROW model (Goal,
  Reality, Options, Will) provides a structured framework for coaching conversations. Positive
  psychology coaching focuses on leveraging client strengths rather than remedying deficits.
