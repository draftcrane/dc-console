<h1>Team Effectiveness Research Summary</h1>
<h2>Psychological Safety</h2>
<p>
  Tuckman's model describes four stages of group development: forming, storming, norming, and
  performing (1965). Psychological safety, defined by Edmondson (1999), enables team members to take
  interpersonal risks without fear of punishment. Google's Project Aristotle found that
  psychological safety was the most important factor distinguishing high-performing teams. Social
  loafing — reduced individual effort in groups — increases with group size and decreases with task
  meaningfulness. Groupthink occurs when the desire for consensus overrides realistic appraisal of
  alternatives, often leading to poor decisions. Cross-functional teams bring diverse expertise but
  face coordination challenges due to different professional languages and priorities. Virtual team
  effectiveness depends on establishing clear communication norms and building trust through
  consistent follow-through. Conflict in teams is not inherently destructive; task-related conflict
  can improve decision quality when managed constructively. "The best teams are not those that avoid
  conflict but those that have learned to disagree productively," observed Lencioni (2002). Team
  cohesion is positively correlated with performance, but excessive cohesion can lead to insularity
  and resistance to outside input. Tuckman's model describes four stages of group development:

<h3>Types of Team Conflict</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Task conflict:</strong> Disagreements about the work itself</li>
  <li><strong>Relationship conflict:</strong> Interpersonal friction and tension</li>
  <li><strong>Process conflict:</strong> Disputes about how work should be done</li>
</ul>
