        "htmlContent": "<p>The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the\r       greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is\r       anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the\r       division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general\r       business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in\r       what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly\r       supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps\r       that it really is carried further in them than in others of more\r       importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to\r       supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number\r       of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\r       different branch of the work can often be collected into the same\r       workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.</p>\n<p>In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply\r       the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of\r       the work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to\r       collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one\r       time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such\r       manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much\r       greater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the\r       division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less\r       observed.</p>\n<p>To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one\r       in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the\r       trade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the\r       division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the\r       use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same\r       division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps,\r       with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not\r       make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not\r       only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number\r       of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One\r       man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth\r       points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make\r       the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a\r       peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\r       itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a\r       pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations,\r       which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though\r       in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have\r       seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed,\r       and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct\r       operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but\r       indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when\r       they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a\r       day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling\r       size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of\r       forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth\r       part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\r       thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought\r       separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated\r       to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made\r       twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two\r       hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part\r       of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a\r       proper division and combination of their different operations.</p>\n<p>In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour\r       are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of\r       them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so\r       great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far\r       as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable\r       increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different\r       trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in\r       consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried\r       furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and\r       improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society,\r       being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved\r       society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer,\r       nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce\r       any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great\r       number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of\r       the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the\r       wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\r       dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit\r       of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one\r       business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so\r       entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the\r       trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The\r       spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the\r       ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the\r       corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of\r       labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible\r       that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This\r       impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the\r       different branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the\r       reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this\r       art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The\r       most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in\r       agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more\r       distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\r       lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\r       bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\r       fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much\r       more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In\r       agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more\r       productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more\r       productive, as it commonly is in manufactures.</p>"

In the same way maximum prosperity\r for each employee means not only higher wages than are usually received\r by men of his class, but, of more importance still, it also means the\r development of each man to his state of maximum efficiency, so that he\r may be able to do, generally speaking, the highest grade of work for\r which his natural abilities fit him, and it further means giving him,\r when possible, this class of work to do.</p>\n<p>It would seem to be so self-evident that maximum prosperity for the\r employer, coupled with maximum prosperity for the employee, ought to be\r the two leading objects of management, that even to state this fact\r should be unnecessary. And yet there is no question that, throughout the\r industrial world, a large part of the organization of employers, as well\r as employees, is for war rather than for peace, and that perhaps the\r majority on either side do not believe that it is possible so to arrange\r their mutual relations that their interests become identical.</p>\n<p>The majority of these men believe that the fundamental interests of\r employees and employers are necessarily antagonistic. Scientific\r management, on the contrary, has for its very foundation the firm\r conviction that the true interests of the two are one and the same; that\r prosperity for the employer cannot exist through a long term of years\r unless it is accompanied by prosperity for the employee, and vice versa;\r and that it is possible to give the workman what he most wants--high\r wages--and the employer what he wants--a low labor cost--for his\r manufactures.</p>\n<p>It is hoped that some at least of those who do not sympathize with each\r of these objects may be led to modify their views; that some employers,\r whose attitude toward their workmen has been that of trying to get the\r largest amount of work out of them for the smallest possible wages, may\r be led to see that a more liberal policy toward their men will pay them\r better; and that some of those workmen who begrudge a fair and even a\r large profit to their employers, and who feel that all of the fruits of\r their labor should belong to them, and that those for whom they work and\r the capital invested in the business are entitled to little or nothing,\r may be led to modify these views.</p>\n<p>No one can be found who will deny that in the case of any single\r individual the greatest prosperity can exist only when that individual\r has reached his highest state of efficiency; that is, when he is turning\r out his largest daily output.</p>\n<p>The truth of this fact is also perfectly clear in the case of two men\r working together. To illustrate: if you and your workman have become so\r skilful that you and he together are making two pairs of, shoes in a\r day, while your competitor and his workman are making only one pair, it\r is clear that after selling your two pairs of shoes you can pay your\r workman much higher wages than your competitor who produces only one\r pair of shoes is able to pay his man, and that there will still be\r enough money left over for you to have a larger profit than your\r competitor.</p>\n<p>In the case of a more complicated manufacturing establishment, it should\r also be perfectly clear that the greatest permanent prosperity for the\r workman, coupled with the greatest prosperity for the employer, can be\r brought about only when the work of the establishment is done with the\r smallest combined expenditure of human effort, plus nature's resources,\r plus the cost for the use of capital in the shape of machines,\r buildings, etc. Or, to state the same thing in a different way: that the\r greatest prosperity can exist only as the result of the greatest\r possible productivity of the men and machines of the establishment--that\r is, when each man and each machine are turning out the largest possible\r output; because unless your men and your machines are daily turning out\r more work than others around you, it is clear that competition will\r prevent your paying higher wages to your workmen than are paid to those\r of your competitor. And what is true as to the possibility of paying\r high wages in the case of two companies competing close beside one\r another is also true as to whole districts of the country and even as to\r nations which are in competition. In a word, that maximum prosperity can\r exist only as the result of maximum productivity. Later in this paper\r illustrations will be given of several companies which are earning large\r dividends and at the same time paying from 30 per cent to 100 per cent\r higher wages to their men than are paid to similar men immediately\r around them, and with whose employers they are in competition. These\r illustrations will cover different types of work, from the most\r elementary to the most complicated.</p>\n<p>If the above reasoning is correct, it follows that the most important\r object of both the workmen and the management should be the training and\r development of each individual in the establishment, so that he can do\r (at his fastest pace and with the maximum of efficiency) the highest\r class of work for which his natural abilities fit him.</p>\n<p>These principles appear to be so self-evident that many men may think it\r almost childish to state them. Let us, however, turn to the facts, as\r they actually exist in this country and in England. The English and\r American peoples are the greatest sportsmen in the world. Whenever an\r American workman plays baseball, or an English workman plays cricket, it\r is safe to say that he strains every nerve to secure victory for his\r side. He does his very best to make the largest possible number of runs.\r The universal sentiment is so strong that any man who fails to give out\r all there is in him in sport is branded as a &quot;quitter,&quot; and treated with\r contempt by those who are around him.</p>\n<p>When the same workman returns to work on the following day, instead of\r using every effort to turn out the largest possible amount of work, in a\r majority of the cases this man deliberately plans to do as little as he\r safely can to turn out far less work than he is well able to do in many\r instances to do not more than one-third to one-half of a proper day's\r work. And in fact if he were to do his best to turn out his largest\r possible day's work, he would be abused by his fellow-workers for so\r doing, even more than if he had proved himself a &quot;quitter&quot; in sport.</p>"

From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected\r variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.</p>\n<p>This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some\r length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural\r Selection almost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved\r forms of life and induces what I have called Divergence of Character.\r In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws\r of variation and of correlation of growth. In the four succeeding\r chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will\r be given: namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in\r understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and\r perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed\r organ; secondly the subject of Instinct, or the mental powers of\r animals, thirdly, Hybridism, or the infertility of species and the\r fertility of varieties when intercrossed; and fourthly, the\r imperfection of the Geological Record. In the next chapter I shall\r consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time;\r in the eleventh and twelfth, their geographical distribution throughout\r space; in the thirteenth, their classification or mutual affinities,\r both when mature and in an embryonic condition. In the last chapter I\r shall give a\r brief recapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks.</p>\n<p>No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in\r regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due\r allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations\r of all the beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species\r ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has\r a narrow range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest\r importance, for they determine the present welfare, and, as I believe,\r the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world.\r Still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable\r inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its\r history. Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I\r can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and\r dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most\r naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that\r each species has been independently created—is erroneous. I am fully\r convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to\r what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other\r and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged\r varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species.\r Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main\r but not exclusive means of modification.</p>\n<p>CHAPTER I.\r VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.</p>\n<p>Causes of Variability. Effects of Habit. Correlation of Growth.\r Inheritance. Character of Domestic Varieties. Difficulty of\r distinguishing between Varieties and Species. Origin of Domestic\r Varieties from one or more Species. Domestic Pigeons, their Differences\r and Origin. Principle of Selection anciently followed, its Effects.\r Methodical and Unconscious Selection. Unknown Origin of our Domestic\r Productions. Circumstances favourable to Man’s power of Selection.</p>\n<p>When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of\r our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which\r strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other,\r than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of\r nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals\r which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under\r the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to\r conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic\r productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform\r as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have\r been exposed under nature. There is, also, I think, some probability in\r the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be\r partly connected with excess of food. It seems pretty clear that\r organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new\r conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation; and\r that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally\r continues to vary for many generations.\r No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under\r cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often\r yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable\r of rapid improvement or modification.</p>\n<p>It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability,\r whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late\r period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception.\r Geoffroy St. Hilaire’s experiments show that unnatural treatment of the\r embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by\r any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly\r inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be\r attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been\r affected prior to the act of conception. Several reasons make me\r believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which\r confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive\r system; this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other\r part of the organisation, to the action of any change in the conditions\r of life. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things\r more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even\r in the many cases when the male and female unite. How many animals\r there are which will not breed, though living long under not very close\r confinement in their native country! This is generally attributed to\r vitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display the utmost\r vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few such cases it has\r been found out that very trifling changes, such as a little more or\r less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether\r or not the plant sets a seed. I cannot here enter on the copious\r details which I have collected on\r this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which\r determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may just\r mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this\r country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the\r plantigrades or bear family; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the\r rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants\r have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the\r most sterile hybrids.</p>"

Scientific\r management, on the contrary, has for its very foundation the firm\r conviction that the true interests of the two are one and the same; that\r prosperity for the employer cannot exist through a long term of years\r unless it is accompanied by prosperity for the employee, and vice versa;\r and that it is possible to give the workman what he most wants--high\r wages--and the employer what he wants--a low labor cost--for his\r manufactures.</p>\n<p>It is hoped that some at least of those who do not sympathize with each\r of these objects may be led to modify their views; that some employers,\r whose attitude toward their workmen has been that of trying to get the\r largest amount of work out of them for the smallest possible wages, may\r be led to see that a more liberal policy toward their men will pay them\r better; and that some of those workmen who begrudge a fair and even a\r large profit to their employers, and who feel that all of the fruits of\r their labor should belong to them, and that those for whom they work and\r the capital invested in the business are entitled to little or nothing,\r may be led to modify these views.</p>\n<p>No one can be found who will deny that in the case of any single\r individual the greatest prosperity can exist only when that individual\r has reached his highest state of efficiency; that is, when he is turning\r out his largest daily output.</p>\n<p>The truth of this fact is also perfectly clear in the case of two men\r working together. To illustrate: if you and your workman have become so\r skilful that you and he together are making two pairs of, shoes in a\r day, while your competitor and his workman are making only one pair, it\r is clear that after selling your two pairs of shoes you can pay your\r workman much higher wages than your competitor who produces only one\r pair of shoes is able to pay his man, and that there will still be\r enough money left over for you to have a larger profit than your\r competitor.</p>\n<p>In the case of a more complicated manufacturing establishment, it should\r also be perfectly clear that the greatest permanent prosperity for the\r workman, coupled with the greatest prosperity for the employer, can be\r brought about only when the work of the establishment is done with the\r smallest combined expenditure of human effort, plus nature's resources,\r plus the cost for the use of capital in the shape of machines,\r buildings, etc. Or, to state the same thing in a different way: that the\r greatest prosperity can exist only as the result of the greatest\r possible productivity of the men and machines of the establishment--that\r is, when each man and each machine are turning out the largest possible\r output; because unless your men and your machines are daily turning out\r more work than others around you, it is clear that competition will\r prevent your paying higher wages to your workmen than are paid to those\r of your competitor. And what is true as to the possibility of paying\r high wages in the case of two companies competing close beside one\r another is also true as to whole districts of the country and even as to\r nations which are in competition.</p>"

        "htmlContent": "<p>industry, economy,\r and perseverance in self-improvement, to eminence, is the most\r remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men. It is\r in itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be\r attained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following Franklin's\r maxims.</p>\n<p>Franklin's fame, however, was not confined to his own country.\r Although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of\r scientific and political thought and activity, yet no less a keen\r judge and critic than Lord Jeffrey, the famous editor of the\r _Edinburgh Review_, a century ago said that &quot;in one point of view\r the name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of\r the others which illustrated the eighteenth century. Distinguished as\r a statesman, he was equally great as a philosopher, thus uniting in\r himself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits, to excel\r in either of which is deemed the highest praise.&quot;</p>\n<p>Franklin has indeed been aptly called &quot;many-sided.&quot; He was eminent in\r science and public service, in diplomacy and in literature. He was the\r Edison of his day, turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit\r of his fellow-men. He perceived the identity of lightning and\r electricity and set up the lightning rod. He invented the Franklin\r stove, still widely used, and refused to patent it. He possessed a\r masterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs. Carlyle called\r him the father of all the Yankees. He founded a fire company, assisted\r in founding a hospital, and improved the cleaning and lighting of\r streets. He developed journalism, established the American\r Philosophical Society, the public library in Philadelphia, and the\r University of Pennsylvania. He organized a postal system for the\r colonies, which was the basis of the present United States Post\r Office. Bancroft, the eminent historian, called him &quot;the greatest\r diplomatist of his century.&quot; He perfected the Albany Plan of Union for\r the colonies. He is the only statesman who signed the Declaration of\r Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Peace\r with England, and the Constitution. As a writer, he has produced, in\r his _Autobiography_ and in _Poor Richard's Almanac_, two works that\r are not surpassed by similar writing. He received honorary degrees\r from Harvard and Yale, from Oxford and St. Andrews, and was made a\r fellow of the Royal Society, which awarded him the Copley gold medal\r for improving natural knowledge. He was one of the eight foreign\r associates of the French Academy of Science.</p>\n<p>The careful study of the _Autobiography_ is also valuable because of\r the style in which it is written. If Robert Louis Stevenson is right\r in believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then\r the youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly,\r forcibly, and interestingly cannot do better than to study Franklin's\r method. Franklin's fame in the scientific world was due almost as much\r to his modest, simple, and sincere manner of presenting his\r discoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which\r he described his experiments, as to the results he was able to\r announce. Sir Humphry Davy, the celebrated English chemist, himself an\r excellent literary critic as well as a great scientist, said: &quot;A\r singular felicity guided all Franklin's researches, and by very small\r means he established very grand truths. The style and manner of his\r publication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the\r doctrine it contains.&quot;</p>\n<p>Franklin's place in literature is hard to determine because he was not\r primarily a literary man. His aim in his writings as in his life work\r was to be helpful to his fellow-men. For him writing was never an end\r in itself, but always a means to an end. Yet his success as a\r scientist, a statesman, and a diplomat, as well as socially, was in no\r little part due to his ability as a writer. &quot;His letters charmed all,\r and made his correspondence eagerly sought. His political arguments\r were the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents. His\r scientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple\r and so clear that plow-boy and exquisite could follow his thought or\r his experiment to its conclusion.&quot;[1]</p>\n<p>[1] _The Many-Sided Franklin._ Paul L. Ford.</p>\n<p>As far as American literature is concerned, Franklin has no\r contemporaries. Before the _Autobiography_ only one literary work of\r importance had been produced in this country--Cotton Mather's\r _Magnalia_, a church history of New England in a ponderous, stiff\r style. Franklin was the first American author to gain a wide and\r permanent reputation in Europe. The _Autobiography_, _Poor Richard_,\r _Father Abraham's Speech_ or _The Way to Wealth_, as well as some of\r the _Bagatelles_, are as widely known abroad as any American writings.\r Franklin must also be classed as the first American humorist.</p>"

Died at Florence on 22nd\r June 1527._</p>\n<p>INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p>Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the\r second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,\r and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were\r members of the old Florentine nobility.</p>\n<p>His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly\r enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of\r Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an\r Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de’ Medici, Il Magnifico.\r The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year\r Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career\r Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted\r until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his\r office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they\r were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli’s\r literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few\r weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his\r fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.</p>\n<p>YOUTH — Æt. 1-25—1469-94</p>\n<p>Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the\r Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of\r this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been\r described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by\r the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving\r Lorenzo. Savonarola’s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have\r been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the\r fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a\r gibe in _The Prince_, where he is cited as an example of an unarmed\r prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean\r rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli\r strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to\r Lorenzo’s grandson that he dedicates _The Prince_.</p>\n<p>Machiavelli, in his “History of Florence,” gives us a picture of the\r young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: “They were freer\r than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other\r kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,\r and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with\r wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly\r was thought the wisest.” In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli\r shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and\r leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes:\r “I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,\r especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than\r which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to\r me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your\r share.” Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: “This will turn\r out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then,\r you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters\r and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I\r have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success\r and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help\r you if you help yourself.”</p>\n<p>OFFICE — Æt. 25-43—1494-1512</p>\n<p>The second period of Machiavelli’s life was spent in the service of the\r free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the\r expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After\r serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed\r Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and\r Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of\r Machiavelli’s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the\r affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and\r dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere\r recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and\r soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and\r supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters\r which illustrate _The Prince_.</p>\n<p>His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, “my lady of Forli”\r of _The Prince_, from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it\r is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on\r fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is\r urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.</p>\n<p>In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for\r continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct\r of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft\r summarized in _The Prince_, and was consequently driven out. He, also,\r it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support\r to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge\r that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the\r faith of princes.</p>\n<p>Machiavelli’s public life was largely occupied with events arising out\r of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the\r Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of _The\r Prince_. Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke\r for the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have\r seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the\r pattern of Cesare Borgia’s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed\r by some critics as the “hero” of _The Prince_.</p>"

We address\r       ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk\r       to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a\r       beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his\r       fellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon it entirely. The\r       charity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him with the whole fund\r       of his subsistence. But though this principle ultimately provides him with\r       all the necessaries of life which he has occasion for, it neither does nor\r       can provide him with them as he has occasion for them. The greater part of\r       his occasional wants are supplied in the same manner as those of other\r       people, by treaty, by barter, and by purchase. With the money which one\r       man gives him he purchases food. The old clothes which another bestows\r       upon him he exchanges for other clothes which suit him better, or for\r       lodging, or for food, or for money, with which he can buy either food,\r       clothes, or lodging, as he has occasion.</p>\n<p>As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one\r       another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in\r       need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives\r       occasion to the division of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds, a\r       particular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness\r       and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or\r       for venison, with his companions; and he finds at last that he can, in\r       this manner, get more cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the\r       field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the\r       making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a\r       sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their\r       little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way\r       to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with\r       venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself\r       entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In\r       the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a tanner\r       or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of\r       savages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus\r       part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own\r       consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he may\r       have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular\r       occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or\r       genius he may possess for that particular species of business.</p>\n<p>The difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much\r       less than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to\r       distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is\r       not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division\r       of labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between\r       a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not\r       so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came\r       in to the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence,\r       they were, perhaps, very much alike, and neither their parents nor\r       play-fellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or\r       soon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The\r       difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by\r       degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to\r       acknowledge scarce any resemblance. But without the disposition to truck,\r       barter, and exchange, every man must have procured to himself every\r       necessary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All must have had the\r       same duties to perform, and the same work to do, and there could have been\r       no such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great\r       difference of talents.</p>\n<p>As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so\r       remarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same\r       disposition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals,\r       acknowledged to be all of the same species, derive from nature a much more\r       remarkable distinction of genius, than what, antecedent to custom and\r       education, appears to take place among men. By nature a philosopher is not\r       in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a\r       mastiff is from a grey-hound, or a grey-hound from a spaniel, or this last\r       from a shepherd’s dog. Those different tribes of animals, however, though\r       all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another. The strength\r       of the mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of\r       the greyhound, or by the sagacity of the spaniel, or by the docility of\r       the shepherd’s dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents,\r       for want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be\r       brought into a common stock, and do not in the least contribute to the\r       better accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each animal is still\r       obliged to support and defend itself, separately and independently, and\r       derives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which\r       nature has distinguished its fellows.</p>"

        "htmlContent": "<p>the most elaborate cooperation. And, briefly, through a series of\r illustrations, to convince the reader that whenever these principles are\r correctly applied, results must follow which are truly astounding.</p>\n<p>This paper was originally prepared for presentation to the American\r Society of Mechanical Engineers. The illustrations chosen are such as,\r it is believed, will especially appeal to engineers and to managers of\r industrial and manufacturing establishments, and also quite as much to\r all of the men who are working in these establishments. It is hoped,\r however, that it will be clear to other readers that the same principles\r can be applied with equal force to all social activities: to the\r management of our homes; the management of our farms; the management of\r the business of our tradesmen, large and small; of our churches, our\r philanthropic institutions our universities, and our governmental\r departments.</p>\n<p>CHAPTER I</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTALS OF SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT</p>\n<p>The principal object of management should be to secure the maximum\r prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity for\r each employee.</p>\n<p>The words &quot;maximum prosperity&quot; are used, in their broad sense, to mean\r not only large dividends for the company or owner, but the development\r of every branch of the business to its highest state of excellence, so\r that the prosperity may be permanent. In the same way maximum prosperity\r for each employee means not only higher wages than are usually received\r by men of his class, but, of more importance still, it also means the\r development of each man to his state of maximum efficiency, so that he\r may be able to do, generally speaking, the highest grade of work for\r which his natural abilities fit him, and it further means giving him,\r when possible, this class of work to do.</p>\n<p>It would seem to be so self-evident that maximum prosperity for the\r employer, coupled with maximum prosperity for the employee, ought to be\r the two leading objects of management, that even to state this fact\r should be unnecessary. And yet there is no question that, throughout the\r industrial world, a large part of the organization of employers, as well\r as employees, is for war rather than for peace, and that perhaps the\r majority on either side do not believe that it is possible so to arrange\r their mutual relations that their interests become identical.</p>\n<p>The majority of these men believe that the fundamental interests of\r employees and employers are necessarily antagonistic. Scientific\r management, on the contrary, has for its very foundation the firm\r conviction that the true interests of the two are one and the same; that\r prosperity for the employer cannot exist through a long term of years\r unless it is accompanied by prosperity for the employee, and vice versa;\r and that it is possible to give the workman what he most wants--high\r wages--and the employer what he wants--a low labor cost--for his\r manufactures.</p>\n<p>It is hoped that some at least of those who do not sympathize with each\r of these objects may be led to modify their views; that some employers,\r whose attitude toward their workmen has been that of trying to get the\r largest amount of work out of them for the smallest possible wages, may\r be led to see that a more liberal policy toward their men will pay them\r better; and that some of those workmen who begrudge a fair and even a\r large profit to their employers, and who feel that all of the fruits of\r their labor should belong to them, and that those for whom they work and\r the capital invested in the business are entitled to little or nothing,\r may be led to modify these views.</p>\n<p>No one can be found who will deny that in the case of any single\r individual the greatest prosperity can exist only when that individual\r has reached his highest state of efficiency; that is, when he is turning\r out his largest daily output.</p>\n<p>The truth of this fact is also perfectly clear in the case of two men\r working together. To illustrate: if you and your workman have become so\r skilful that you and he together are making two pairs of, shoes in a\r day, while your competitor and his workman are making only one pair, it\r is clear that after selling your two pairs of shoes you can pay your\r workman much higher wages than your competitor who produces only one\r pair of shoes is able to pay his man, and that there will still be\r enough money left over for you to have a larger profit than your\r competitor.</p>\n<p>In the case of a more complicated manufacturing establishment, it should\r also be perfectly clear that the greatest permanent prosperity for the\r workman, coupled with the greatest prosperity for the employer, can be\r brought about only when the work of the establishment is done with the\r smallest combined expenditure of human effort, plus nature's resources,\r plus the cost for the use of capital in the shape of machines,\r buildings, etc. Or, to state the same thing in a different way: that the\r greatest prosperity can exist only as the result of the greatest\r possible productivity of the men and machines of the establishment--that\r is, when each man and each machine are turning out the largest possible\r output; because unless your men and your machines are daily turning out\r more work than others around you, it is clear that competition will\r prevent your paying higher wages to your workmen than are paid to those\r of your competitor. And what is true as to the possibility of paying\r high wages in the case of two companies competing close beside one\r another is also true as to whole districts of the country and even as to\r nations which are in competition. In a word, that maximum prosperity can\r exist only as the result of maximum productivity.</p>"

The number of useful\r       and productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is everywhere in\r       proportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting\r       them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The\r       second book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital stock, of the\r       manner in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different\r       quantities of labour which it puts into motion, according to the different\r       ways in which it is employed.</p>\n<p>Nations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in\r       the application of labour, have followed very different plans in the\r       general conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been\r       equally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some\r       nations has given extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the\r       country; that of others to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has\r       dealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry. Since the\r       down-fall of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more\r       favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns,\r       than to agriculture, the Industry of the country. The circumstances which\r       seem to have introduced and established this policy are explained in the\r       third book.</p>\n<p>Though those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the\r       private interests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without any\r       regard to, or foresight of, their consequences upon the general welfare of\r       the society; yet they have given occasion to very different theories of\r       political economy; of which some magnify the importance of that industry\r       which is carried on in towns, others of that which is carried on in the\r       country. Those theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon\r       the opinions of men of learning, but upon the public conduct of princes\r       and sovereign states. I have endeavoured, in the fourth book, to explain\r       as fully and distinctly as I can those different theories, and the\r       principal effects which they have produced in different ages and nations.</p>\n<p>To explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the\r       people, or what has been the nature of those funds, which, in different\r       ages and nations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of\r       these four first books. The fifth and last book treats of the revenue of\r       the sovereign, or commonwealth.</p>"

What other reforms, among those\r which are being discussed by these two nations, could do as much toward\r promoting prosperity, toward the diminution of poverty, and the\r alleviation of suffering? America and England have been recently\r agitated over such subjects as the tariff, the control of the large\r corporations on the one hand, and of hereditary power on the other hand,\r and over various more or less socialistic proposals for taxation, etc.\r On these subjects both peoples have been profoundly stirred, and yet\r hardly a voice has been raised to call attention to this vastly greater\r and more important subject of &quot;soldiering,&quot; which directly and\r powerfully affects the wages, the prosperity, and the life of almost\r every working-man, and also quite as much the prosperity of every\r industrial, establishment in the nation.</p>\n<p>The elimination of &quot;soldiering&quot; and of the several causes of slow\r working would so lower the cost of production that both our home and\r foreign markets would be greatly enlarged, and we could compete on more\r than even terms with our rivals. It would remove one of the fundamental\r causes for dull times, for lack of employment, and for poverty, and\r therefore would have a more permanent and far-reaching effect upon these\r misfortunes than any of the curative remedies that are now being used to\r soften their consequences. It would insure higher wages and make shorter\r working hours and better working and home conditions possible.</p>\n<p>Why is it, then, in the face of the self-evident fact that maximum\r prosperity can exist only as the result of the determined effort of each\r workman to turn out each day his largest possible day's work, that the\r great majority of our men are deliberately doing just the opposite, and\r that even when the men have the best of intentions their work is in most\r cases far from efficient?</p>\n<p>There are three causes for this condition, which may be briefly\r summarized as:</p>\n<p>First. The fallacy, which has from time immemorial been almost universal\r among workmen, that a material increase in the output of each man or\r each machine in the trade would result in the end in throwing a large\r number of men out of work.</p>\n<p>Second. The defective systems of management which are in common use, and\r which make it necessary for each workman to soldier, or work slowly, in\r order that he may protect his own best interests.</p>\n<p>Third. The inefficient rule-of-thumb methods, which are still almost\r universal in all trades, and in practicing which our workmen waste a\r large part of their effort.</p>\n<p>This paper will attempt to show the enormous gains which would result\r from the substitution by our workmen of scientific for rule-of-thumb\r methods.</p>\n<p>To explain a little more fully these three causes:</p>\n<p>First. The great majority of workmen still believe that if they were to\r work at their best speed they would be doing a great injustice to the\r whole trade by throwing a lot of men out of work, and yet the history of\r the development of each trade shows that each improvement, whether it be\r the invention of a new machine or the introduction of a better method,\r which results in increasing the productive capacity of the men in the\r trade and cheapening the costs, instead of throwing men out of work make\r in the end work for more men.</p>\n<p>The cheapening of any article in common use almost immediately results\r in a largely increased demand for that article. Take the case of shoes,\r for instance. The introduction of machinery for doing every element of\r the work which was formerly done by hand has resulted in making shoes at\r a fraction of their former labor cost, and in selling them so cheap that\r now almost every man, woman, and child in the working-classes buys one\r or two pairs of shoes per year, and wears shoes all the time, whereas\r formerly each workman bought perhaps one pair of shoes every five years,\r and went barefoot most of the time, wearing shoes only as a luxury or as\r a matter of the sternest necessity. In spite of the enormously increased\r output of shoes per workman, which has come with shoe machinery, the\r demand for shoes has so increased that there are relatively more men\r working in the shoe industry now than ever before.</p>\n<p>The workmen in almost every trade have before them an object lesson of\r this kind, and yet, because they are ignorant of the history of their\r own trade even, they still firmly believe, as their fathers did before\r them, that it is against their best interests for each man to turn out\r each day as much work as possible.</p>\n<p>Under this fallacious idea a large proportion of the workmen of both\r countries each day deliberately work slowly so as to curtail the output.\r Almost every labor union has made, or is contemplating making, rules\r which have for their object curtailing the output of their members,\r and those men who have the greatest influence with the working-people,\r the labor leaders as well as many people with philanthropic feelings who\r are helping them, are daily spreading this fallacy and at the same time\r telling them that they are overworked.</p>\n<p>A great deal has been and is being constantly said about &quot;sweat-shop&quot;\r work and conditions. The writer has great sympathy with those who are\r overworked, but on the whole a greater sympathy for those who are under\r paid. For every individual, however, who is overworked, there are a\r hundred who intentionally under work--greatly under work--every day of\r their lives, and who for this reason deliberately aid in establishing\r those conditions which in the end inevitably result in low wages. And\r yet hardly a single voice is being raised in an endeavor to correct this\r evil.</p>\n<p>As engineers and managers, we are more intimately acquainted with these\r facts than any other class in the community, and are therefore best\r fitted to lead in a movement to combat this fallacious idea by educating\r not only the workmen but the whole of the country as to the true facts.\r And yet we are practically doing nothing in this direction, and are\r leaving this field entirely in the hands of the labor agitators (many of\r whom are misinformed and misguided), and of sentimentalists who are\r ignorant as to actual working conditions.</p>\n<p>Second.</p>"

        "htmlContent": "<p>division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general\r       business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in\r       what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly\r       supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps\r       that it really is carried further in them than in others of more\r       importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to\r       supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number\r       of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\r       different branch of the work can often be collected into the same\r       workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.</p>\n<p>In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply\r       the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of\r       the work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to\r       collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one\r       time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such\r       manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much\r       greater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the\r       division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less\r       observed.</p>\n<p>To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one\r       in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the\r       trade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the\r       division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the\r       use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same\r       division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps,\r       with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not\r       make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not\r       only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number\r       of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One\r       man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth\r       points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make\r       the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a\r       peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\r       itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a\r       pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations,\r       which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though\r       in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have\r       seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed,\r       and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct\r       operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but\r       indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when\r       they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a\r       day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling\r       size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of\r       forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth\r       part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\r       thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought\r       separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated\r       to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made\r       twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two\r       hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part\r       of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a\r       proper division and combination of their different operations.</p>\n<p>In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour\r       are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of\r       them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so\r       great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far\r       as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable\r       increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different\r       trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in\r       consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried\r       furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and\r       improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society,\r       being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved\r       society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer,\r       nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce\r       any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great\r       number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of\r       the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the\r       wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\r       dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit\r       of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one\r       business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so\r       entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the\r       trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The\r       spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the\r       ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the\r       corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of\r       labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible\r       that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them.</p>"

If among a nation of hunters, for\r       example, it usually costs twice the labour to kill a beaver which it does\r       to kill a deer, one beaver should naturally exchange for or be worth two\r       deer. It is natural that what is usually the produce of two days or two\r       hours labour, should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one\r       day’s or one hour’s labour.</p>\n<p>If the one species of labour should be more severe than the other, some\r       allowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship; and the\r       produce of one hour’s labour in the one way may frequently exchange for\r       that of two hour’s labour in the other.</p>\n<p>Or if the one species of labour requires an uncommon degree of dexterity\r       and ingenuity, the esteem which men have for such talents, will naturally\r       give a value to their produce, superior to what would be due to the time\r       employed about it. Such talents can seldom be acquired but in consequence\r       of long application, and the superior value of their produce may\r       frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time and\r       labour which must be spent in acquiring them. In the advanced state of\r       society, allowances of this kind, for superior hardship and superior\r       skill, are commonly made in the wages of labour; and something of the same\r       kind must probably have taken place in its earliest and rudest period.</p>\n<p>In this state of things, the whole produce of labour belongs to the\r       labourer; and the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or\r       producing any commodity, is the only circumstance which can regulate the\r       quantity of labour which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or\r       exchange for.</p>\n<p>As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some\r       of them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people,\r       whom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to make a\r       profit by the sale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the\r       value of the materials. In exchanging the complete manufacture either for\r       money, for labour, or for other goods, over and above what may be\r       sufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the\r       workmen, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker of the\r       work, who hazards his stock in this adventure. The value which the workmen\r       add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into two\r       parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits of their\r       employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he advanced. He\r       could have no interest to employ them, unless he expected from the sale of\r       their work something more than what was sufficient to replace his stock to\r       him; and he could have no interest to employ a great stock rather than a\r       small one, unless his profits were to bear some proportion to the extent\r       of his stock.</p>\n<p>The profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name\r       for the wages of a particular sort of labour, the labour of inspection and\r       direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated by quite\r       different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the\r       hardship, or the ingenuity of this supposed labour of inspection and\r       direction. They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock\r       employed, and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this\r       stock. Let us suppose, for example, that in some particular place, where\r       the common annual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent. there\r       are two different manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen are\r       employed, at the rate of fifteen pounds a year each, or at the expense of\r       three hundred a-year in each manufactory. Let us suppose, too, that the\r       coarse materials annually wrought up in the one cost only seven hundred\r       pounds, while the finer materials in the other cost seven thousand. The\r       capital annually employed in the one will, in this case, amount only to\r       one thousand pounds; whereas that employed in the other will amount to\r       seven thousand three hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per cent.\r       therefore, the undertaker of the one will expect a yearly profit of about\r       one hundred pounds only; while that of the other will expect about seven\r       hundred and thirty pounds. But though their profits are so very different,\r       their labour of inspection and direction may be either altogether or very\r       nearly the same. In many great works, almost the whole labour of this kind\r       is committed to some principal clerk. His wages properly express the value\r       of this labour of inspection and direction. Though in settling them some\r       regard is had commonly, not only to his labour and skill, but to the trust\r       which is reposed in him, yet they never bear any regular proportion to the\r       capital of which he oversees the management; and the owner of this\r       capital, though he is thus discharged of almost all labour, still expects\r       that his profit should bear a regular proportion to his capital. In the\r       price of commodities, therefore, the profits of stock constitute a\r       component part altogether different from the wages of labour, and\r       regulated by quite different principles.</p>\n<p>In this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always\r       belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of\r       the stock which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labour commonly\r       employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, the only circumstance\r       which can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase,\r       command or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be\r       due for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished\r       the materials of that labour.</p>\n<p>As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the\r       landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and\r       demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the\r       grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when\r       land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them,\r       come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must\r       then pay for the licence to gather them, and must give up to the landlord\r       a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion,\r       or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes\r       the rent of land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities,\r       makes a third component part.</p>\n<p>The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be\r       observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of\r       them, purchase or command.</p>"

I may\r venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies,\r although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists.</p>\n<p>From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this\r Abstract to Variation under Domestication. We shall thus see that a\r large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible, and, what\r is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of\r man in accumulating by his Selection successive slight variations. I\r will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature;\r but I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too\r briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues\r of facts. We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances\r are most favourable to variation. In the next chapter the Struggle for\r Existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world, which\r inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of\r increase, will be treated of. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied\r to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. As many more individuals of\r each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently,\r there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that\r any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to\r itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life,\r will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be _naturally\r selected_. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected\r variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.</p>\n<p>This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some\r length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural\r Selection almost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved\r forms of life and induces what I have called Divergence of Character.\r In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws\r of variation and of correlation of growth. In the four succeeding\r chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will\r be given: namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in\r understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and\r perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed\r organ; secondly the subject of Instinct, or the mental powers of\r animals, thirdly, Hybridism, or the infertility of species and the\r fertility of varieties when intercrossed; and fourthly, the\r imperfection of the Geological Record. In the next chapter I shall\r consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time;\r in the eleventh and twelfth, their geographical distribution throughout\r space; in the thirteenth, their classification or mutual affinities,\r both when mature and in an embryonic condition. In the last chapter I\r shall give a\r brief recapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks.</p>\n<p>No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in\r regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due\r allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations\r of all the beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species\r ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has\r a narrow range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest\r importance, for they determine the present welfare, and, as I believe,\r the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world.\r Still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable\r inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its\r history. Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I\r can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and\r dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most\r naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that\r each species has been independently created—is erroneous. I am fully\r convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to\r what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other\r and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged\r varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species.\r Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main\r but not exclusive means of modification.</p>\n<p>CHAPTER I.\r VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.</p>\n<p>Causes of Variability. Effects of Habit. Correlation of Growth.\r Inheritance. Character of Domestic Varieties. Difficulty of\r distinguishing between Varieties and Species. Origin of Domestic\r Varieties from one or more Species. Domestic Pigeons, their Differences\r and Origin. Principle of Selection anciently followed, its Effects.\r Methodical and Unconscious Selection. Unknown Origin of our Domestic\r Productions. Circumstances favourable to Man’s power of Selection.</p>\n<p>When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of\r our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which\r strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other,\r than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of\r nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals\r which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under\r the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to\r conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic\r productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform\r as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have\r been exposed under nature. There is, also, I think, some probability in\r the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be\r partly connected with excess of food. It seems pretty clear that\r organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new\r conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation; and\r that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally\r continues to vary for many generations.\r No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under\r cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often\r yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable\r of rapid improvement or modification.</p>\n<p>It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability,\r whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late\r period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception.\r Geoffroy St. Hilaire’s experiments show that unnatural treatment of the\r embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by\r any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly\r inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be\r attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been\r affected prior to the act of conception. Several reasons make me\r believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which\r confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive\r system; this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other\r part of the organisation, to the action of any change in the conditions\r of life. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things\r more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even\r in the many cases when the male and female unite.</p>"

It would remove one of the fundamental\r causes for dull times, for lack of employment, and for poverty, and\r therefore would have a more permanent and far-reaching effect upon these\r misfortunes than any of the curative remedies that are now being used to\r soften their consequences. It would insure higher wages and make shorter\r working hours and better working and home conditions possible.</p>\n<p>Why is it, then, in the face of the self-evident fact that maximum\r prosperity can exist only as the result of the determined effort of each\r workman to turn out each day his largest possible day's work, that the\r great majority of our men are deliberately doing just the opposite, and\r that even when the men have the best of intentions their work is in most\r cases far from efficient?</p>\n<p>There are three causes for this condition, which may be briefly\r summarized as:</p>\n<p>First. The fallacy, which has from time immemorial been almost universal\r among workmen, that a material increase in the output of each man or\r each machine in the trade would result in the end in throwing a large\r number of men out of work.</p>\n<p>Second. The defective systems of management which are in common use, and\r which make it necessary for each workman to soldier, or work slowly, in\r order that he may protect his own best interests.</p>\n<p>Third. The inefficient rule-of-thumb methods, which are still almost\r universal in all trades, and in practicing which our workmen waste a\r large part of their effort.</p>\n<p>This paper will attempt to show the enormous gains which would result\r from the substitution by our workmen of scientific for rule-of-thumb\r methods.</p>\n<p>To explain a little more fully these three causes:</p>\n<p>First. The great majority of workmen still believe that if they were to\r work at their best speed they would be doing a great injustice to the\r whole trade by throwing a lot of men out of work, and yet the history of\r the development of each trade shows that each improvement, whether it be\r the invention of a new machine or the introduction of a better method,\r which results in increasing the productive capacity of the men in the\r trade and cheapening the costs, instead of throwing men out of work make\r in the end work for more men.</p>\n<p>The cheapening of any article in common use almost immediately results\r in a largely increased demand for that article. Take the case of shoes,\r for instance. The introduction of machinery for doing every element of\r the work which was formerly done by hand has resulted in making shoes at\r a fraction of their former labor cost, and in selling them so cheap that\r now almost every man, woman, and child in the working-classes buys one\r or two pairs of shoes per year, and wears shoes all the time, whereas\r formerly each workman bought perhaps one pair of shoes every five years,\r and went barefoot most of the time, wearing shoes only as a luxury or as\r a matter of the sternest necessity. In spite of the enormously increased\r output of shoes per workman, which has come with shoe machinery, the\r demand for shoes has so increased that there are relatively more men\r working in the shoe industry now than ever before.</p>\n<p>The workmen in almost every trade have before them an object lesson of\r this kind, and yet, because they are ignorant of the history of their\r own trade even, they still firmly believe, as their fathers did before\r them, that it is against their best interests for each man to turn out\r each day as much work as possible.</p>\n<p>Under this fallacious idea a large proportion of the workmen of both\r countries each day deliberately work slowly so as to curtail the output.\r Almost every labor union has made, or is contemplating making, rules\r which have for their object curtailing the output of their members,\r and those men who have the greatest influence with the working-people,\r the labor leaders as well as many people with philanthropic feelings who\r are helping them, are daily spreading this fallacy and at the same time\r telling them that they are overworked.</p>\n<p>A great deal has been and is being constantly said about &quot;sweat-shop&quot;\r work and conditions. The writer has great sympathy with those who are\r overworked, but on the whole a greater sympathy for those who are under\r paid. For every individual, however, who is overworked, there are a\r hundred who intentionally under work--greatly under work--every day of\r their lives, and who for this reason deliberately aid in establishing\r those conditions which in the end inevitably result in low wages. And\r yet hardly a single voice is being raised in an endeavor to correct this\r evil.</p>\n<p>As engineers and managers, we are more intimately acquainted with these\r facts than any other class in the community, and are therefore best\r fitted to lead in a movement to combat this fallacious idea by educating\r not only the workmen but the whole of the country as to the true facts.\r And yet we are practically doing nothing in this direction, and are\r leaving this field entirely in the hands of the labor agitators (many of\r whom are misinformed and misguided), and of sentimentalists who are\r ignorant as to actual working conditions.</p>\n<p>Second. As to the second cause for soldiering--the relations which exist\r between employers and employees under almost all of the systems of\r management which are in common use--it is impossible in a few words to\r make it clear to one not familiar with this problem why it is that the\r ignorance of employers as to the proper time in which work of various\r kinds should be done makes it for the interest of the workman to\r &quot;soldier.&quot;</p>\n<p>The writer therefore quotes herewith from a paper read before The\r American Society of Mechanical Engineers, in June, 1903, entitled &quot;Shop\r Management,&quot; which it is hoped will explain fully this cause for\r soldiering:</p>\n<p>&quot;This loafing or soldiering proceeds from two causes. First, from the\r natural instinct and tendency of men to take it easy, which may be\r called natural soldiering. Second, from more intricate second thought\r and reasoning caused by their relations with other men, which may be\r called systematic soldiering.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;There is no question that the tendency of the average man (in all walks\r of life) is toward working at a slow, easy gait, and that it is only\r after a good deal of thought and observation on his part or as a result\r of example, conscience, or external pressure that he takes a more rapid\r pace.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;There are, of course, men of unusual energy, vitality, and ambition who\r naturally choose the fastest gait, who set up their own standards, and\r who work hard, even though it may be against their best interests. But\r these few uncommon men only serve by forming a contrast to emphasize the\r tendency of the average.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;This common tendency to 'take it easy' is greatly increased by bringing\r a number of men together on similar work and at a uniform standard rate\r of pay by the day.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Under this plan the better men gradually but surely slow down their\r gait to that of the poorest and least efficient. When a naturally\r energetic man works for a few days beside a lazy one, the logic of the\r situation is unanswerable.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Why should I work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay that I\r do and does only half as much work?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;A careful time study of men working under these conditions will\r disclose facts which are ludicrous as well as pitiable.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;To illustrate: The writer has timed a naturally energetic workman who,\r while going and coming from work, would walk at a speed of from three to\r four miles per hour, and not infrequently trot home after a day's work.\r On arriving at his work he would immediately slow down to a speed of\r about one mile an hour. When, for example, wheeling a loaded\r wheelbarrow, he would go at a good fast pace even up hill in order to be\r as short a time as possible under load, and immediately on the return\r walk slow down to a mile an hour, improving every opportunity for delay\r short of actually sitting down. In order to be sure not to do more than\r his lazy neighbor, he would actually tire himself in his effort to go\r slow.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;These men were working under a foreman of good reputation and highly\r thought of by his employer, who, when his attention was called to this\r state of things, answered: 'Well, I can keep them from sitting down, but\r the devil can't make them get a move on while they are at work.</p>"

        "htmlContent": "<p>From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came\r into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the _Pilgrim's\r Progress_, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate\r little volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's\r _Historical Collections_; they were small chapmen's books,[16] and\r cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly\r of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since\r often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for\r knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it was\r now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's _Lives_ there was\r in which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great\r advantage. There was also a book of DeFoe's, called an _Essay on\r Projects_, and another of Dr. Mather's, called _Essays to do Good_,\r which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on\r some of the principal future events of my life.</p>\n<p>[16] Small books, sold by chapmen or peddlers.</p>\n<p>This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a\r printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession. In\r 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters\r to set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of\r my father, but still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent the\r apprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to\r have me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last was\r persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years\r old. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of\r age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.\r In a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became\r a useful hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. An\r acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes\r to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean.\r Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when\r the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the\r morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.</p>\n<p>And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who\r had a pretty collection of books, and who frequented our\r printing-house, took notice of me, invited me to his library, and\r very kindly lent me such books as I chose to read. I now took a fancy\r to poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might\r turn to account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional\r ballads. One was called _The Lighthouse Tragedy_, and contained an\r account of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters:\r the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of _Teach_ (or\r Blackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched stuff, in the\r Grub-street-ballad style;[17] and when they were printed he sent me\r about the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event\r being recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity; but\r my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling me\r verse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most\r probably a very bad one; but as prose writing has been of great use to\r me in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my\r advancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired\r what little ability I have in that way.</p>\n<p>[17] Grub-street: famous in English literature as the\r     home of poor writers.</p>\n<p>There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with\r whom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes disputed, and very fond\r we were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another,\r which disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad\r habit, making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the\r contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence,\r besides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of\r disgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for\r friendship. I had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute\r about religion. Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom\r fall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts\r that have been bred at Edinborough.</p>\n<p>A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,\r of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their\r abilities for study. He was of opinion that it was improper, and that\r they were naturally unequal to it. I took the contrary side, perhaps a\r little for dispute's sake. He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready\r plenty of words, and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his\r fluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted without\r settling the point, and were not to see one another again for some\r time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair\r and sent to him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of\r a side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read\r them. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk\r to me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the\r advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I\r ow'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of\r expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by\r several instances. I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grew\r more attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at\r improvement.</p>\n<p>About this time I met with an odd volume of the _Spectator_.[18] It was\r the third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it\r over and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing\r excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I\r took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in\r each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at\r the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each\r hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed\r before, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I\r compared my _Spectator_ with the original, discovered some of my\r faults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or\r a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should\r have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since\r the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different\r length, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme,\r would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for\r variety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make\r me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them\r into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the\r prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections\r of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce\r them into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences\r and compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement\r of thoughts. By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I\r discovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the\r pleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, I\r had been lucky enough to improve the method of the language, and this\r encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable\r English writer, of which I was extremely ambitious. My time for these\r exercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it began\r in the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the\r printing-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendance\r on public worship which my father used to exact of me when I was under\r his care, and which indeed I still thought a duty, thought I could\r not, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it.</p>\n<p>[18] A daily London journal, comprising satirical essays\r     on social subjects, published by Addison and Steele in\r     1711-1712. The _Spectator_ and its predecessor, the\r     _Tatler_ (1709), marked the beginning of periodical\r     literature.</p>\n<p>When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by\r one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it.\r My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded\r himself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat\r flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my\r singularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing\r some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty\r pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he\r would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would\r board myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I\r could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for\r buying books. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and the\r rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there\r alone, and, dispatching presently my light repast, which often was no\r more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart\r from the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time\r till their return for study, in which I made the greater progress,\r from that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which\r usually attend temperance in eating and drinking.</p>\n<p>And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my\r ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at\r school, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through the\r whole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller's and Shermy's\r books of Navigation, and became acquainted with the little geometry\r they contain; but never proceeded far in that science. And I read\r about this time Locke _On Human Understanding_,[19] and the _Art of\r Thinking_, by Messrs. du Port Royal.[20]</p>\n<p>[19] John Locke (1632-1704), a celebrated English\r     philosopher, founder of the so-called &quot;common-sense&quot;\r     school of philosophers. He drew up a constitution for\r     the colonists of Carolina.</p>\n<p>[20] A noted society of scholarly and devout men\r     occupying the abbey of Port Royal near Paris, who\r     published learned works, among them the one here\r     referred to, better known as the _Port Royal Logic_.</p>\n<p>While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English\r grammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there were\r two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter\r finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic[21] method; and\r soon after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein\r there are many instances of the same method. I was charm'd with it,\r adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation,\r and put on the humble inquirer and doubter.</p>"
